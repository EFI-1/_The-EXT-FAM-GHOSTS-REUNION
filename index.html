  INT. (INTERIOR SCENE) The Special INVESTIGATORs-in Charge Office BUILDING COMPLEX - NIGHT-TIME
  
  ...And so our story begins one afternoon at the Special INVESTIGATORs-in charge Office Complex...
  
  ...As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the city, (2) Special INVESTIGATORs-in charge, "INVESTIGATOR 1" ("Special INVESTIGATOR-in charge [1]") and "INVESTIGATOR 2" ("Special INVESTIGATOR-in charge [2]"), sat in their dimly lit office, poring over a stack of ("unWRITHEn") report(ss) ("basically just" stacks of reams of blank printer paper). The air was thick with the scent of coffee and the finest TOBACCO LEAFSMOKE procure-able in TENALE-RALDEY/Tenale-Raldey County; and (of course) the hum of the overhead fluorescent lights...
  
  [...SOUNDTRACK: Sabrina Carpenter - Espresso (''C.V.'' [Clean Version]1,2).m4a, PLAYS ON IN THE BACKGROUND...];]
  
  Tiësto & Ava Max - The Motto
  
  ...INVESTIGATOR 1 leaned back in their chair, rubbing Their temples...
  
  INVESTIGATOR 1
  "Something doesn't add up, [INVESTIGATOR 2]. Look at these reports (that have been written). The patterns are too consistent to be a coincidence."
  
  INVESTIGATOR 2 nodded, his eyes narrowing on the HIGHLIGHTS as he scanned the documents.
  
  INVESTIGATOR 2
  "You're right, [REDACTED]. The break-ins, the missing persons, the unexplained fires... It's all too neatly connected. But what's the link?"
  
  ...INVESTIGATOR 1 tapped a finger on the desk rhythmically, and as it slowly became a marching beat; he was [BEGINNING TO EXPERIENCE] being deep in His Profoundest Thoughts (like he used to do in "his Arm.y (Armenian) Days")...
  
  INVESTIGATOR 1
  "I think it's time we paid a visit to The Olde Warehouses District, to [THIS SPECIFIC WAREHOUSE]. There's been too much activity there 'as of: LATE[LY]', and I've got 'have a hunch' it's more than just a (set of) coincidences."
  
  ...INVESTIGATOR 2 grabbed his coat and nodded with deliberation...
  
  INVESTIGATOR 2
  "Let's not get so fuckin' mathematical with it, [REDACTED]. (I Say,) Let's go. If there's something going on, we'll surely find it 'then & there' & now."

  EXT.
   - - 
  City of TENALE-RALDEY
  ...City/Streets
   - - 
  NIGHT-TIME
  
  ...(And So) The Special INVESTIGATORs-in charge, INVESTIGATOR 1 and INVESTIGATOR 2, drove through the quiet city-streets, the citylight(s) casting beautiful & eerie reflections on the wet pavement. INVESTIGATOR 2, in the passenger's seat, reflected & brushed upon some optics theory; he thought about how curious it was that light's photons had enough time to travel in every direction poossible, always, at all times; about the way that photons emitted from a streetlamp's rain-waterdrop were able to fire off photons in even his direction as they fell to the asphalt. (["Photons are just so damn fast."]), "she"/he thought, deep in His Profoundest Thoughts Ever Up To That Point...
  
  EXT. That Specific Warehouse They Had Seen On The Online Maps, "Teh Parking Lot" - NIGHT-TIME
  
  ...They pulled up to the old warehouse, its silhouette looming ominously against the night sky. INVESTIGATOR 1 put the car into Park and both INVESTIGATORs were immediately hit with a Mental.CHATMESSAGE left behind by someone who [HAD BEEN THERE PREVIOUSLY]. It was in Spanish. As the INVESTIGATORs sat there, in the car, together, listening to the message in fireign-tongue(s), they both [vs.SIMULTANEOUSLY PEAKED] and simultaneously felt one of the most eerie (cascading) feelings they had ever felt up to that point in their lives [(For INVESTIGATOR 1, the "eerie cascading feeling" started near his [PERINEUM].)]...
  
  INVESTIGATOR 2
  "You know I don't speak (Spanish)..."
  
  INVESTIGATOR 1
  "Yeah, I don't know what that was, 'man', I couldn't really understand the accent & dialect..."
  
  INVESTIGATOR 2
  "Oh well ('G A Y')..."
  
  [...Soundtrack: Bain - Love Safe.mp3 PLAYS ON on the car stereo system...]
  
  ...INVESTIGATOR 1 "cut the engine", and they both sat in silence for ("[AND] yet") another moment, taking in the scene (taking it all [all of the scene] in)... This Specific Warehouse happened to be a relic of the past; its once-vibrant façade now faded and covered in graffiti. Broken windows and rusted metal doors hinted at years of neglect & vandalism...
  
  ...Special INVESTIGATOR-in charge 2 leaned forward, as respectfully as possible; peering through the windshield, at the warehouse driveway. The light reflected from the driveway's mud indicated something to him and he expressed as much:..
  
  INVESTIGATOR 2
  "Look at those tire tracks, they're 'fresh'. Someone's been here recently!"
  
  ...INVESTIGATOR-in charge 1 nodded, their eyes scanning the perimeter.
  
  INVESTIGATOR 2
  "And (you) see that light [FLICKERING] inside? It's faint, but it's THERE. Someone's definitely using this place."
  
  ...INVESTIGATOR 2 reached for their flashlight, their grip tightening...
  
  INVESTIGATOR 2
  "We need to be careful. If this is what we think it is, we could be walking into something big. Did you bring your 'stun-gun'?"
  
  INVESTIGATOR 1
  "Yeah."
  
  INVESTIGATOR 2
  "Should we bring it or leave it in the car?"
  
  INVESTIGATOR 1
  "I'm gonna leave it. If I need it, I'll run back to the car to get it."
  
  INVESTIGATOR 2
  "Alright man, here we go..."
  
  ...INVESTIGATOR 1 took a deep breath, their mind racing with The Possibilities.
  
  INVESTIGATOR 1
  "Let's circle around and see if we can find another way in. We need to gather as much information as we can before making a move (making a DECISION)."

  Visit To A Warehouse 1
  
  EXT. That Specific Warehouse They Had Seen On The Online Maps, "Teh Doorway Entrance" - NIGHT-TIME
  
  ...As the clock "struck midtnight", Special INVESTIGATORs 1 & 2 arrived at the abandoned warehouse's Doorway Entrance from the Driveway Entrance. The moonlightcast eerie_shadows on the dilapidated building, and the air was thick with Their Anticipation. They exchanged "a [KNOWING] glance", their flashlights cutting through the darkness as they approached the entrance...
  
  INVESTIGATOR 1
  "Stay sharp. We don't know what we're walking into."
  
  ...Special INVESTIGATOR 2 nodded, gripping their flashlight tighter. The door creaked open, revealing a vast, empty space filled with old crates and rusted machinery. The sound of their footsteps echoed through the cavernous room...
  
  INVESTIGATOR 2
  "Let's split up and cover more ground,"
  
  ...INVESTIGATOR 2 [suggested]...
  
  INVESTIGATOR 2
  "I'll take the left side, you take the right."
  
  ...INVESTIGATOR 1 agreed, went ["RIGHT then..."], and said nothing more. They moved cautiously, their senses heightened as they walked around the rusted machinery and cracked conveyor belts which looked like broken-down Army Tank wheeled-trackers. As they navigated through The Maze of Crates, they noticed strange markings reflecting from "on the floor" which turned out to be... MUDDY SHOEPRINTS!, they were leading ever-deeper into the warehouse...
  
  ...Following The Trail of Tear(s) & Clues, INVESTIGATOR 1 stumbled unto the threshold of a hidden doorwell, partially concealed behind a stack of crates...
  
  INVESTIGATOR 2
  "Over here,"
  
  INVESTIGATOR 1 called out to 2 softly.
  
  CTRL+v...INVESTIGATOR 2 hurried over, and together they pushed the crate(ss) aside, revealing the door. It was locked, but one [(1)] of the INVESTIGATORs produced a set of lock-picking tools from their pocket. With a few deft movements, the lock clicked open...

  ["...The door swung open, revealing a dimly lit stairwell (a staircase) leading down into the depths of the warehouse's BASEMENT. The investigators exchanged a determined look and descended the stairs, their flashlights illuminating the way..."];
  
  ["...At the bottom, they found themselves in a secret underground chamber, That Specific Warehouse's CATACOMBS. The room was filled with rusty & dusty high-tech equipment and surveillance monitors which were actually still ON & displaying live feeds from various locations. It was clear that this was no ordinary warehouse..."];

  [PLACEHOLDER TEXT];
  
  INVESTIGATOR 2
  "Looks like we've stumbled onto something big,"
  
  INVESTIGATOR 2 remarked, their eyes scanning the room nervously...
  
  INVESTIGATOR 1 nodded,
  
  INVESTIGATOR 1
  "Let's gather as much evidence as we can. This could be the break we've been looking for."
  
  The INVESTIGATORS descended the first stairwell leading down into the catacombs/basements... There were cardboard boxes and doorway threshold flashings strewn about as litter, somebody was covering their tracks. Both investigators could tell based on the cleanliness of the concrete landing into the doorway at the stairwell's landing...
  
  INVESTIGATOR 1
  ...This place STINKS...
  
  ...Said INVESTIGATOR 1...
  INVESTIGATOR 2
  And... Here is the reason why... They're keeping a sink-full of dirty dishes in that sink to make it seem like this place is abandoned. They are covering their tracks using stuff that may never make a difference. It almost did in this case but thanks to our surveillance technology, we know these guys are the guys for sure...
  
  INVESTIGATOR 1
  Talking to the TV again?.. Hey, it's Investigator 1, here to remind you: 'ALL ROADS LEAD TO 'GAYNUS''...

  [PLACEHOLDER TEXT];
  
  INVESTIGATOR 2
  This guy... Wow, this place, is big. Look at the next room.
  
  THE INVESTIGATORS ENTER THE MASSIVE PARKING LOT, BASEMENT LEVEL _#1, IT IS DARK, THE KITCHEN LIGHT FADES INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE PARKING LOT'S STRUCTURAL COLUMNS...
  
  ...INVESTIGATOR 2 IS STAYING CLOSE TO THE DOOR, THEY PLACE THEIR HAND ON THEIR HOLSTERED Glock 19...
  
  ...INVESTIGATOR 1 KICKS ON A FLASHLIGHT, THEY GO DOWN THE MIDDLE DRIVEWAY FIRST...
  
  ...THERE IS LITTER EVERYWHERE, PEOPLE HAD BEEN LIVING HERE AND THEY LEFT A BIG MESS. THE INVESTIGATORS KICK CARDBOARD BOXES OUT OF THEIR WAY AS THEY CUT THROUGH THE LITTER TO GET TO THE BOTTOM...
  
  ...X-RAY VIEW OF THE TWO (HUMAN \SKELETAL) MODELS WALKING DOWN A WIDE CONCRETE PARKING LOT DRIVEWAY, KICKING OVERSIZED CLEAR-PLASTIC TRASHBAGS AND CARDBOARD BOXES OUT OF THEIR WAY, AN [AGENT_TYPE/A.I._worker] DROPS DEAD IN THE SURVEILLANCE ROOM...
