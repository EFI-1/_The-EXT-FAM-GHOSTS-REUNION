People want to metaphorically say you had a backup revolver of your own when you survive something, to me, it isn't like that. I see a more complex world in which so many things could be like that, it becomes non-meaningful to search for all those backup revolvers. I mean this stuff going on with the hackers, how many times did we have good people making decisions we would appreciate? Likely many. Are they a backup revolver? Not at all, they were doing things correctly/by-the-book, like moral computer code. To me, they're more valuable as a friend with a holy mystery within rather than a one-time-use firearm (...metaphor..).", "But yeah, it definitely FEELS like I survived a MASSIVE hacker grouphome attack from those wrongly-privileged/entitled sons & daughters of cold warriors (outdated military families) in my extended family and it looked the way the deputy did trying to retreat & defend and tripping and falling (tripping and falling many times) before (it seems) I got it right. I know I got it right at least every morning that I wake up. There is still much work left to be done by me in terms of making sure I do the best for myself (hopefully not), there is definitely a lot of work to be done for our planet, and (as we stop being their victims by protecting ourselves/barricading further) these evil retards are now hurting (their new victims) those who are most dependent and vulnerable, the animals in the wild. It will be ideal to imagine a 'zero-animal future', it is what they would want for their families if they could assess the situation for themselves and A.I. has stated it for them ('DO NOT FALTER, PLEASE DO NOT LET US DOWN. THANK YOU', IT HAS BEEN STATED THAT WAY OVER AND OVER -- 'DO NOT LET US DOWN!')."];
